/* Your Schedule
 *
 * Use several variables to store the names of your classes and their teachers.
 * Then, display a nice little table displaying your schedule.	Just FYI, my
 * column of courses has a width of 26 characters, and the teacher column has a
 * width of 15. The first and last lines are a plus sign, fifty dashes
 * (a.k.a. minus signs) and another plus sign.
 *
 * Your table doesn't need to look exactly like this, or even line up. I used a
 * total of sixteen variables (course1, course2, ... course8, teacher1, teacher2, etc.).
 * You should do the same.
 *
 * Your output should look like:
 *
