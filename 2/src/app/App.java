/* Write a program that stores your name and year of graduation into variables,
 * and displays their values on the screen.
 *
 * Make sure that you use two variables, and that the variable that holds your
 * name is the best type for such a variable, and that the variable that holds
 * the year is the best type for that variable.
 * 
 * Also make sure that your variable names are good: the name of a variable should
 * always relate to its contents.
 *
 * Your output should look like:
 * My name is Juan Valdez and I'll graduate in 2010.
 * 
 * Notice that in the example above, the values "Juan Valdez" and 2010 have been
 * stored in variables before printing.
